What git command creates a branch?
What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
What git command changes to another branch?
What git command deletes a branch?
How do merge conflicts happen?

git branch + file name or git checkout -b
recursive merge happens when there were many incompleted commits from different branches, yet fast-forward commit is simple
git checkout
git branch -d
when merging, there are different commits in different branches with same file/folder names
